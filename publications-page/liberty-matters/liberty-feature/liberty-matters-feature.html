                            Peter J. Boettke, Professor of Economics and Philosophy at George Mason University, argues that is a common trope to claim
                            that F.A. Hayek experienced a crushing defeat in technical economics during the 1930s. At the beginning of the decade,
                            Hayek emerged in the British scientifhic community as a leading economic theorist. Yet by the end of the decade Hayek was
                            supposedly defeated in his debate both with Keynes and with Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner over market socialism. However,
                            this narrative reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the teachings of economics from the classical to the early
                            neoclassical economists. Economic life from Adam Smith to J. S. Mill never was treated as taking place in an institutional
                            vacuum. Instead, law, politics, and social mores all constituted the institutional background against which economic life played
                            out. As Boettke argues in the Lead Essay, Hayek's epistemic institutionalism, as articulated in the 1930s and 19405, provided
                            the foundation for his own reconstruction and restatement of liberal political economy as evidenced in The Constitution of
                            Liberty (1960) and Law, Legislation and Liberty (1973-79). Recognizing this aspect of Hayek's thought is a hrst step to
                            recognizing hs broader contributions to economic science and the art of political economy. Boettke is joined in this discussion

                            State University, Roger Koppl, professor of finance in the Whitman School of Management of Syracuse University, and Adam
                            Martin is a Political Economy Research Fellow at the Free Market Institute and an assistant professor in the department of

                                    scholars of Adam Smith to reflect on what the great
                                    Scot means to them. WNe hope you enjgy thsis

                                    leaders what liberty means to them. In this edition,
                                    Mustafa Akyol reflects on the relationship between
                                    lberty and lslam, posing some critical questions
                                    about Islam's history which to date have been ittle
                                    considered-by Muslims or others. For example,
                                    was the mariage between lIslam and the state
                                    unavoidable? And even more critical, What was the
                                    first poltical principle that lslam called for? For Akyol
                                    the answer is simple. Liberty.
